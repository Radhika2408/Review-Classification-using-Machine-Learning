# Review-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
Classification of reviews into positive or negative

ABSTRACT

Our project is about understanding the feedback on women's clothes purchased online.
We have analyzed and sorted women's e-commerce clothing reviews into positive and
not positive sentiments. We're using various machine learning models like Logistic
Regression, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Decision tree, and Random Forest to
find the most accurate sentiment classification model for our womenâ€™s clothing
reviews.
But it's not just about classifying reviews. We've also created a user-friendly
dashboard that presents insights and trends from the review data in a simple and clear
way. We've designed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to clearly show the sentiment
of each review. This not only ensures accurate sentiment analysis but also makes it
easy for both businesses and consumers to understand the results in the fast-paced
online clothing world.
